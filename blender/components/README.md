### Electrical Components

3d models and STL files for electrical components I use in blender projects. 

- RotaryEncoder: when making knobs with this, scale the rotary encoder X and Y axes to 1.04x
- ESP32: board size with mounting holes. I use M2 screws even though the holes are big enough for M3 screws because the heads of the M3 screws are too big
- NutPocket: for M3 nut. Size of hole is X=6.75 Y=5.75 Z=3
